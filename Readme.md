<br>
The goal of this project is to reinvent the customer experience with a chatbot that will reduce the response time to questions asked by users. <br>
The only goal of this project is to benchmark the polyglot functionality of the chatbot in the most spoken languages in the world:<br>
<ul>
	<li>Chinese</li>
	<li>Spanish</li>
	<li>English</li>
	<li>Hindi</li>
	<li>Arabic</li>
</ul>

To realize the polyglot function we will use the cognitive service of Azure, with the Text Analytic part.

> You will find the different scripts, benchmarks and solutions in the "/Solution" folder.
